# face_mesh_image_using_mediapipe
In this project we will make fac mesh image using mediapipe.MediaPipe Face Mesh is a solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D facial surface, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor.
